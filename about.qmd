I am an Assistant Clinical Professor of Public Policy and the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Penn State School of Public Policy.

I also lead the School's Next Gen Leadership Academy, a non-credit leadership program for Penn State undergraduate students interested in pursuing careers in public service.

My primary research interests include population health, health disparities, mortality & longevity, demographic methods, technology & innovation policy, and intellectual property law & policy.

I currently teach courses on policy analysis, statistics, and data visualization. 

I am also an English-qualified attorney by professional training. Prior to joining the faculty at the Penn State School of Public Policy, I practiced as an intellectual property attorney in the UK, advising clients in the pharmaceutical, food & beverage, media, and technology industries. Over the course of my legal career, I have worked with a wide range of stakeholders, practicing both as an in-house lawyer -- serving as legal counsel at one of Europe's largest media & entertainment groups -- and as an associate attorney (in private practice) at two top 20 UK-ranked international law firms.
